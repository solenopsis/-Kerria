# Keraiai

Welcome to Keraiai - a Java communication library for SFDC.

## Keraiai vs Lasius?

Currently, [Lasius] (https://github.com/solenopsis/Lasius) contains WSDLs for the Enterprise, Partner, Metadata and Tooling APIs...as well as similar communications functionality as found here.  However, we decided to simplifiy the libraries:
* Keraiai will provide all communications related functionality.
* [Lasius] (https://github.com/solenopsis/Lasius) will provide other general utility functionality.

## What Does Keraiai Mean?

Like all [Solenopsis] (https://github.com/solenopsis) themes, we wanted to choose a Latin or Greek word related to ants.  Since this is project is for SFDC communication, we considered an ant's antenna.  The word [keraiai] (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/antennae) is actually Greek and refers to an insect's horns.
