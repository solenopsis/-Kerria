# Keraiai

Welcome to Keraiai - a Java communication library for SFDC.

containing things like [wsimport] (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/wsimport.html) generated WSDLs for the enterprise, partner, metadata and tooling API.  Please note the WSDLs are simply from an empty Developer org but can be used for logins (to gain session ids), and to invoke the metadata or tooling APIs.

## Keraiai vs Lasius?

Currently, [Lasius] (https://github.com/solenopsis/Lasius) contains WSDLs for the Enterprise, Partner, Metadata and Tooling APIs...as well as similar communications functionality as found here.  However, we decided to simplifiy the libraries:
* Keraiai will provide all communications related functionality.
* [Lasius] (https://github.com/solenopsis/Lasius) will provide other general utility functionality.

## What Does Keraiai Mean?

Like all [Solenopsis] (https://github.com/solenopsis) themes, we wanted to choose a Latin or Greek word related to ants.  Since this is project is for SFDC communication, we considered an ant's antenna.  The word [keraiai] (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/antennae) is actually Greek and refers to an insect's horns.
